## A quick overview

## Registration

For reasons regarding the privacy of discussions, potential users
can only register with BHOS email addresses possessed by BHOS students only. The account pinned above
has the same permissions as any registered user, and you can confidently use it to familiarize
yourself with the platform.

* A technical sidenote. During the regisration, one-time registration links are generated and sent to the email address if the latter is valid.

## Rooms

Create a room, set the topic and description, and start discussions.
Add your own viewpoint in the comment section.

## Request Box

This is where the friendship requests received from others are displayed. You can accept/turn down the request.
Check out friendship requests in `Request Box` (in the navigation bar) and accept the request from admin :D.

## Real-time status checking

Check if your friends are online! The platform also offers a highly accurate
estimate of when they were online the last time.

## Real-time private messaging (currently unavailable in production)

Chat with anyone in your friends list in real-time, in a separate room for you two!
